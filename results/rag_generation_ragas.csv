'response': ""The OECD framework recommends assessing both the explainability and safety of an AI system throughout its lifecycle by considering the following key criteria:\n\n1. **Explainability** (Principle 1.3): The framework suggests asking questions such as:\n\t* Is it clear what the objectives of the AI system are?\n\t* Does the AI system provide useful and meaningful information for understanding its performance and outputs/decisions?\n\t* Can all of the AI system's outputs (both intermediary and final) be explained?\n\t* Can the determinant data or knowledge that an AI system uses to make decisions be identified?\n\t* Do two similar-looking cases verifiably result in similar outcomes?\n2. **Safety, Security, and Robustness** (Principle 1.4): The framework suggests asking questions such as:\n\t* Do safety metrics exist that can evaluate the safety of an AI system for a given use case?\n\t* How does the entity deploying the AI system test for safety during development?\n\t* What measures has the entity deploying the AI system taken to do an adversarial evaluation?\n\t* Does the AI system change significantly if it is trained with variations of the data available?\n\t* Are there measures in place to validate and verify the AI system's outcomes?\n\nThese factors are important for responsible AI deployment because they ensure that AI systems are transparent, accountable, and safe for users and impacted stakeholders. Explainability is crucial for understanding how AI systems make decisions and for identifying potential biases or errors. Safety, security, and robustness are essential for preventing harm to individuals and society, particularly in high-stakes applications such as healthcare, finance, and transportation.\n\nThe OECD framework emphasizes the importance of considering these factors throughout the AI system's lifecycle, from design and development to deployment and maintenance. By doing so, policymakers and developers can ensure that AI systems are designed and deployed in a way that respects human rights and well-being.\n\nReferences:\n[Doc: oecd_ai_classification_framework.pdf, page: 3, 21]"", 'multi_responses': None, 'reference': 'The OECD framework suggests assessing explainability through questions about system objectives, transparency of outputs, traceability, and consistency of outcomes, while safety assessment involves safety metrics, adversarial testing, sensitivity to data variations, and validation/verification measures.
