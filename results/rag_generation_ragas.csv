The framework recommends evaluating these factors by asking questions such as:\n\nFor explainability:\n\n* Is it clear what the objectives of the AI system are?\n* Does the AI system provide useful and meaningful information for understanding its performance and outputs/decisions?\n* Can all of the AI system's outputs be explained?\n* Can the determinant data or knowledge that an AI system uses to make decisions be identified?\n\nFor safety:\n\n* Do safety metrics exist that can evaluate the safety of an AI system for a given use case?\n* How does the entity deploying the AI system test for safety during development?\n* What measures has the entity deploying the AI system taken to do an adversarial evaluation?\n* Are there measures in place to validate and verify the AI system's outcomes?\n\nThese factors are important because they help ensure that AI systems are transparent, accountable, and reliable, which is essential for protecting human rights and well-being.
