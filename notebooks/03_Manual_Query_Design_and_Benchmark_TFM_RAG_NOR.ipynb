      "is used throughout the Commission s communication. The scope of these Guidelines however aims to encompass not only those AI systems made in Europe, but also those developed elsewhere and deployed or used in Europe. Throughout this document, we hence aim to promote trustworthy AI for Europe. The European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies (EGE) is an advisory group of the Commission. See Section 3.3 of COM(2018)237. The Glossary at the end of this document provides a definition of AI systems for the purpose of this document. This definition is further elaborated on in a dedicated document prepared by the AI HLEG that accompanies these Guidelines, titled \"A definition of AI: Main capabilities and scientific disciplines\". benefits that they can bring. To help Europe realise those benefits, our vision is to ensure and scale Trustworthy AI. Trust in the development, deployment and use of AI systems concerns not only the technology s inherent properties, but also the qualities of the socio-technical systems involving AI applications.9 Analogous to questions of (loss of) trust in aviation, nuclear power or food safety, it is not simply components of the AI system but the system in its overall context that may or may not engender trust. Striving towards Trustworthy AI hence concerns not only the trustworthiness of the AI system itself, but requires a holistic and systemic approach, encompassing the trustworthiness of all actors and processes that are part of the system s socio-technical context throughout its entire life cycle. Trustworthy AI has three components, which should be met throughout the system's entire life cycle: 1. it should be lawful, complying with all applicable laws and regulations; 2. it should be ethical, ensuring adherence to ethical principles and values; and 3. it should be robust, both from a technical and social\n"

      "the feedback gathered through this piloting phase, we will revise the assessment list of these Guidelines by early 2020. The piloting phase will be launched by the summer of 2019 and last until the end of the year. All interested stakeholders will be able to participate by indicating their interest through the European AI Alliance. B. A FRAMEWORK FOR TRUSTWORTHY AI These Guidelines articulate a framework for achieving Trustworthy AI based on fundamental rights as enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (EU Charter), and in relevant international human rights law. Below, we briefly touch upon Trustworthy AI s three components. Lawful AI AI systems do not operate in a lawless world. A number of legally binding rules at European, national and international level already apply or are relevant to the development, deployment and use of AI systems today. Legal sources include, but are not limited to: EU primary law (the Treaties of the European Union and its Charter of Fundamental Rights), EU secondary law (such as the General Data Protection Regulation, the Product Liability Directive, the Regulation on the Free Flow of Non-Personal Data, anti-discrimination Directives, consumer law and Safety and Health at Work Directives), the UN Human Rights treaties and the Council of Europe conventions (such as the European Convention on Human Rights), and numerous EU Member State laws. Besides horizontally applicable rules, various domain-specific rules exist that apply to particular AI applications (such as for instance the Medical Device Regulation in the healthcare sector). The law provides both positive and negative obligations, which means that it should not only be interpreted with reference to what cannot be done, but also with reference to what should be done and what may be done. The law not only prohibits certain actions but also enables others.\n"
